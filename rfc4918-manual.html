<h3>11.1.0  207 Multi-Status</h3>
<p>
   The 207 (Multi-Status) status code provides status for multiple
   independent operations (see Section 13 for more information).
</p>

<h3>11.2.0 422 Unprocessable Entity</h3>
<p>

   The 422 (Unprocessable Entity) status code means the server
   understands the content type of the request entity (hence a
   415(Unsupported Media Type) status code is inappropriate), and the
   syntax of the request entity is correct (thus a 400 (Bad Request)
   status code is inappropriate) but was unable to process the contained
   instructions.  For example, this error condition may occur if an XML
   request body contains well-formed (i.e., syntactically correct), but
   semantically erroneous, XML instructions.
</p>

<h3>11.3.0 423 Locked</h3>
<p>

   The 423 (Locked) status code means the source or destination resource
   of a method is locked.  This response SHOULD contain an appropriate
   precondition or postcondition code, such as 'lock-token-submitted' or
   'no-conflicting-lock'.
</p>

<h3>11.4.0  424 Failed Dependency</h3>
<p>

   The 424 (Failed Dependency) status code means that the method could
   not be performed on the resource because the requested action
   depended on another action and that action failed.  For example, if a
   command in a PROPPATCH method fails, then, at minimum, the rest of
   the commands will also fail with 424 (Failed Dependency).
</p>

<h3>11.5.0  507 Insufficient Storage</h3>
<p>

   The 507 (Insufficient Storage) status code means the method could not
   be performed on the resource because the server is unable to store
   the representation needed to successfully complete the request.  This
   condition is considered to be temporary.  If the request that
   received this status code was the result of a user action, the
   request MUST NOT be repeated until it is requested by a separate user
   action.
</p>

<h3>12.1.x  412 Precondition Failed</h3>
<p>
   Any request can contain a conditional header defined in HTTP (If-
   Match, If-Modified-Since, etc.) or the "If" or "Overwrite"
   conditional headers defined in this specification.  If the server
   evaluates a conditional header, and if that condition fails to hold,
   then this error code MUST be returned.  On the other hand, if the
   client did not include a conditional header in the request, then the
   server MUST NOT use this status code.
</p>

<h3>12.2.x  414 Request-URI Too Long</h3>
<p>

   This status code is used in HTTP 1.1 only for Request-URIs, not URIs
   in other locations.
</p>
